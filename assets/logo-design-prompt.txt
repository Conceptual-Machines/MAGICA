In the current Figma page, create a new frame named magda-mark-geo with size 512x512.

Inside this frame, construct a geometrically precise logo with the following specification:
	1.	Place a central circle:
	•	Center at (256, 256)
	•	Radius = 36
	2.	Place four outer circles, all with equal radius:
	•	Radius = 24
	•	Positioned on a perfect circle of radius 140 around the center
	•	Angles in degrees (relative to horizontal, clockwise):
	•	Top-left node: -135°
	•	Top-right node: -45°
	•	Bottom-left node: 135°
	•	Bottom-right node: 45°
	3.	Draw four connecting arms between the central circle and each outer circle:
For each arm:
	•	Shape type: rounded rectangle
	•	Thickness (height) = 20
	•	Length = distance between circle edges (not center-to-center)
	•	Corner radius = 10
	•	Aligned exactly along the vector from the central circle to the outer circle
	•	The rectangle should touch the edge of each circle, not overlap their centers
	4.	Ensure geometric consistency:
	•	All outer circles must have identical size
	•	All arms must have identical thickness and length
	•	All arms must be perfectly centered between their corresponding circles
	•	All elements must be snapped to exact coordinates (no freehand placement)
	5.	Group all elements into a single group named magda-mark.
	6.	Center the group perfectly inside the 512x512 frame.
	7.	Set all fills to a neutral gray and remove strokes (fills only) for now.

Do not stylize, add colors, or adjust visually — focus only on exact geometric construction.
